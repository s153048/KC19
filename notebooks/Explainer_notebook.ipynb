    "1. **Annotated chart**\n",
    "    * Is used for instance to convey what government actions have been put in place by the South Korean Government by annotating a chart over cases with the actions taken, allowing the reader to investigate the connections herself.\n",
    "1. **Slide show**\n",
    "    * An adation of slide shows have been used in multiple places to allow the user to use a dropdown menu to select which angle she wishes to view the data from. For instance by choosing if she wants to see cumulative or non cumulative data in part 1, or to shuffle between different features in part 3.\n",
    "1. **Animation**\n",

    "    \n",
    "The genres have all been chosen with a purpose. The magazine style has been chosen to guide the viewer, and to help her understand the data even though she is not a scientist herself. The annotated charts and the slideshow aims at engaging the reader in looking closer at the data, by giving her the ability to make her own conclusions and investigate the data on her own.

    "For interactivity, 'Hovering', 'Filtering/Selection' and 'Navigation buttons' was provided to let the user engage with the graphs at her own pace to increase engagement, while still providing instructions to ease understanding through the use of 'Explicit instructions', or the use of 'Tacit tutorial' in the risk-profiling part where the user was first shown how the model works and was then given free-pass to play with it as she liked. \n",
    "\n",
    "For messaging, the main goal was to drive the linear story-line and guide the reader through the different charts and interactions to ease understanding and increase engagement. 'Captions and headlines' were generally provided as a quick overview, with 'Annotations' being used in for instance the government actions chart. 'Accompanying text', \n",
    "'Comment repitition', 'Introductory text' and 'Summary synthesis' were all used. The goal of these was to introduce the data to be seen to ease understanding, then accompany it with text and comment repition to make sure the reader got the write take-aways, and finally; Summary synthesis were used to make sure the reader did not forget some important takeaways after the intensive read!
